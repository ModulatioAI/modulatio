# Modulatio

**A multi-model agent framework for running long, high-stakes projects with real quality control.**

Modulatio orchestrates teams of LLM agents — each on its own model and provider — through plan-mode execution with a real quality gate. Designed for work that takes more than one prompt: long-form drafting, small-business loops, multi-step research, codebase work, anything where output quality matters.

> [!WARNING]
> **v0.1.0 — Initial Beta.** This is the first release under the Modulatio name. The engine matured pre-1.0 under a prior name and was validated end-to-end on a heterogeneous live model lineup (reasoning Leader + agentic QC + thinking-off producer) before this release. **2264 tests pass.** Read the [v0.1.0 Beta calibration](https://modulatio.ai/v0-1-0-beta/) page before kicking off serious work — knowing the engine's real ceilings is the difference between a smooth run and a frustrated one. Bug reports + discussions welcome on the [issues tab](https://github.com/ModulatioAI/modulatio/issues) and [discussions](https://github.com/ModulatioAI/modulatio/discussions).

**Requires Python 3.12+.**

## Quick install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ModulatioAI/modulatio.git ~/modulatio
cd ~/modulatio
uv venv && uv pip install -e ".[dev]"
modulatio setup
```

Full install with troubleshooting at <https://modulatio.ai/getting-started/install/>.

> **Why 3.12+?** One of the dependencies (`lancedb`, `fastembed`, or `litellm` depending on platform) hasn't published a wheel for older Pythons and falls back to a source build that often fails. If your `python3` is 3.11 or older, point the venv at `/usr/bin/python3.12` explicitly.

Full documentation lives at **<https://modulatio.ai>**.

- **[Overview](https://modulatio.ai/overview/)** — what Modulatio is, who it's for, the orchestration model.
- **[v0.1.0 Beta calibration](https://modulatio.ai/v0-1-0-beta/)** — what the engine does well, what it does NOT do yet. Read before serious work.
- **[Getting Started](https://modulatio.ai/getting-started/install/)** — install, run the setup wizard, ship your first plan.
- **[Concepts](https://modulatio.ai/concepts/concepts/)** — the mental model: vault, project, plan, agent, skill, standard.
- **[Architecture deep-dives](https://modulatio.ai/architecture/working-memory/)** — five-layer working memory, skill system, sandbox, audit trails.
- **[CLI reference](https://modulatio.ai/reference/cli/)** — every command, every flag.
- **[Roadmap](https://modulatio.ai/roadmap/)** — what's shipping next, what's planned beyond.

## What Modulatio does

- **Multi-model routing per agent.** Each agent (Leader, QC, every producer) runs on its own configured provider + model. Pick a fast/cheap model for routine work and a stronger one for the gate-class seats — native to the architecture, not an afterthought.
- **Quality control as a first-class subsystem.** Three-layer TQM (universal axes × per-artifact-kind standards × per-team overrides). QC reviews every artifact; rejects route back to producers in GENERATE / EDIT / DIFF mode.
- **QC-as-fixer (on by default).** When a producer can't clear the bar after exhausting retries, QC patches the artifact from its own findings and the task completes. Opt out with `MODULATIO_QC_FIXER=0`.
- **Skills over fixed roles.** Agents are compositions of skills; skills are conversationally creatable and persist to your vault.
- **Plan-mode end-to-end.** Leader is a conversational partner, plan is the unit of execution, daemon-driven async, Telegram approvals, full audit trail.
- **Open architecture.** Your data, your vault, your providers, your models. No SaaS, no per-instance subscription.
