# Modulatio

**A multi-model agent framework for running long, high-stakes projects with real quality control.**

Modulatio orchestrates teams of LLM agents — each on its own model and provider — through plan-mode execution with a real quality gate. Designed for work that takes more than one prompt: long-form drafting, small-business loops, multi-step research, codebase work, anything where output quality matters.

> [!WARNING]
> **v0.6.0 — Beta.** The **role-language migration** — three structural fixes the engine needed before its next chapter. **Routing reality:** the keystone (*a producer is a model endpoint; dispatch routes on capability + availability and never blocks*) was only wired on the interactive path — now it holds on **every headless path** (daemon/cron/Job-Templates, plan-mode sub-objectives, TUI), so producer work actually runs on the model dispatch picked instead of silently collapsing onto one. **No more roles:** `specialist` and `researcher` are gone — there are only **producers** that compose skills from the shared library, and research is just a capability a producer holds (old `defaults.json` still loads via read-fallback). **Operator-presence-aware Leader:** the Leader now **judges** when it runs autonomously (headless — it is the only check past QC) and **defers** to you when you're present, replacing a blunt global *"bias toward continue"* with a principled gate; its between-task self-correction ships **on by default when nobody's watching**. Builds on v0.5.0's per-job output folders + Job Templates, v0.4.0's **skill self-codification**, and v0.3.0's **skill-library keystone**. See the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) for the full delta. Each of the three bricks cleared fresh **hull + coherence** reviews; validated end-to-end on live heterogeneous model lineups. **2550 tests pass.** Read the [Beta calibration](https://modulatio.ai/v0-1-0-beta/) page before kicking off serious work — knowing the engine's real ceilings is the difference between a smooth run and a frustrated one. Bug reports + discussions welcome on the [issues tab](https://github.com/ModulatioAI/modulatio/issues) and [discussions](https://github.com/ModulatioAI/modulatio/discussions).

**Requires Python 3.12+.**

## Quick install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ModulatioAI/modulatio.git ~/modulatio
cd ~/modulatio
uv venv && uv pip install -e ".[dev]"
modulatio setup
```

Full install with troubleshooting at <https://modulatio.ai/getting-started/install/>.

> **Why 3.12+?** One of the dependencies (`lancedb`, `fastembed`, or `litellm` depending on platform) hasn't published a wheel for older Pythons and falls back to a source build that often fails. If your `python3` is 3.11 or older, point the venv at `/usr/bin/python3.12` explicitly.

## What Modulatio does

- **Multi-model routing per agent.** Each agent (Leader, QC, every producer) runs on its own configured provider + model. Pick a fast/cheap model for routine work and a stronger one for the gate-class seats — native to the architecture, not an afterthought.
- **Quality control as a first-class subsystem.** Three-layer TQM (universal axes × per-artifact-kind standards × per-team overrides). QC reviews every artifact; rejects route back to producers in GENERATE / EDIT / DIFF mode.
- **QC-as-fixer (on by default).** Cheap, fast producers generate the bulk of the work; the smarter QC reviews it and *patches only the errors* — the cost of a cheap model with the quality of a strong one (speculative decoding, applied to agents). When a producer can't clear the bar, QC authors the fix from its own findings and the task completes. Bundled default standards give QC a real bar from a cold start. Opt out with `MODULATIO_QC_FIXER=0`.
- **Product Quality Report.** Every run ships an advisory note (`.docx`) in the project lead's own voice — what it stands behind and what it recommends you double-check. Honest caveats, never a gate: reservations the swarm can't resolve are surfaced here, never block the work or open a ticket.
- **Finished products, delivered — one folder per job.** Producers write Markdown; the lead's tagged deliverables render to `.docx`, human-named from the document title, into a **per-job folder** under `~/Documents/Modulatio/<project>/` (named from the job and date, with a hex tiebreaker only on collision) so each run keeps its own products instead of overwriting the last. The Product Quality Report ships inside the same folder.
- **Job Templates — setup that sticks.** For work you do more than once, the Leader can codify a **Job Template**: its own interview, parameter schema, and output contract for that *class* of job — domain-agnostic (a single report, an N-piece anthology, a per-competitor brief are all the same primitive over a generic output cardinality). Bind it to a concrete answer set and it runs headless on a schedule — every cron job is a bound template, validated when you add it, never failing at 3am. The team notices when you keep running the same kind of job (or redo one) and offers to template it: the setup-side mirror of skill self-codification.
- **A producer is a model endpoint that learns.** No fixed roles and no skills to assign — give a producer an LLM and tag what it's good at; the team composes the skills each task needs from a shared, **git-versioned** library at run-time, and routing never blocks on a capability gap. When the same defect keeps recurring, the team **codifies** the correction into durable skill guidance that cheap producers load next time, so it gets quietly better at the work you give it.
- **Plan-mode end-to-end.** Leader is a conversational partner, plan is the unit of execution, daemon-driven async, Telegram approvals, full audit trail.
- **Open architecture.** Your data, your vault, your providers, your models. No SaaS, no per-instance subscription.
